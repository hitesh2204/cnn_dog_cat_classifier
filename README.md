### Dog vs Cat CNN Classifier
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier that can accurately distinguish between images of dogs and cats. The classifier is trained on a large dataset of labeled dog and cat images, allowing it to learn the distinguishing features of each animal and make accurate predictions.
Features
Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in classifying dog and cat images.
The CNN model is built using the TensorFlow framework, which provides excellent support for training and deploying deep learning models.
The classifier can handle both single images and batch processing, making it suitable for various use cases.
The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of diverse dog and cat images, ensuring robustness and generalization.
Provides easy-to-use functions for loading, preprocessing, and predicting on new images.
The classifier can be easily integrated into existing applications or used as a standalone tool for dog and cat image classification.
